    The reason why I use { get; set; } is because it allows the value to be read and written.
    But, why just not write it like this?:

    public string Response;

    Because, adding { get; set; } methods make it more flexible to be used, that's why I preferred to the regular variable declaration way. It's
    like, instead of having a public space where everything can be changed and seen, I place a door, so now it is private and I decide what, how, why 
    and when it is changed, at least, that's how I understand it.
